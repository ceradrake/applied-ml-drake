Clarity & Organization (Is the notebook structured and easy to follow?) - It is well structured and easy to follow along with. There are clear headlines and numbered sections. 
Feature Selection & Justification (Do the chosen features make sense given the objectives?) He chose 'odor' and 'bruises' for his features. His were similar to the features I used/ my goal. They made sense for the chosen goal. 
Model Performance & Comparisons (Are the results and comparisons clearly explained?) He used the a support vector machine and the random forest model. Both were clearly explained and provided similar results. 
Reflection Quality (Are insights well thought out?) Yes. He did a good job of comparing the models and explaining why there might be differences.
